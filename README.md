# purescript-halogen-leaflet

Use [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) in
[Halogen](https://github.com/slamdata/halogen/).

Unfortunately, I haven't gotten around to writing much documentation yet, so
you'll have to figure things out yourself based on the source code. But hey,
type signatures are all the documentation you could possibly need, right?
RIGHT?

Anyway, look at `examples/example01` for a bit of a usage impression.
